A simple chat room app that uses built-in sockets in Unix and Python to communicate with a server over TCP, like a Ununtu home server or localhost.

In the 'MAC' and 'WINDOWS' folders I will in a future update include executables. They will be located in the /dir/ folder.

Just run the script in terminal otherwise and enter an IP, PORT, and Username. Press 'Connect'. Then the app will take you to the main screen.
The chat_server.py is the server side of the app, and chat_client.py the client side.
Uses tkinter as GUI.
There will be a writable spot at the lower part of the window, to send text press 'Enter' or 'Return'.
The listbox will automatically move down when the texts exceed the vertical space.
