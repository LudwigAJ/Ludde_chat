A simple chat room app that uses built-in sockets in Unix and Python to communicate with any server, like a Ununtu home server.

In the 'MAC' and 'WINDOWS' folders I will in a future update include executables. They will be located in the /dir/ folder.

Just run the script in terminal otherwise and enter an IP, PORT, and Username. Press 'Connect'. Then the app will take you to the main screen.
The python scripts are in the SCRIPTS directory. The chat_server.py is the server side of the app, and chat_client.py the client side.
Uses tkinter as GUI.
There will be a writable spot at the lower part of the window, to send text press 'Enter' or 'Return'.
The lsitbox will automatically move down when the texts exceed the vertical space.
